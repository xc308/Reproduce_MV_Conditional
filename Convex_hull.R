#============

# a subset of a Euclidean spaceï¼Œ is convex if, given any two points, it contains the whole line segment that joins them
# the boundary of a convex set is always a convex curve. 

# The intersection of all the convex sets that contain a given subset A of Euclidean space is called the convex hull of A. 
# It is the smallest convex set containing A.
